# Surfs Up - Business Plan

## Overview of Analysis

In this project, we are investigating the weather conditions on the island of Oahu in order to determine whether the surf and icecream shop that we are hoping to open will be sustainable year-round. 

## Results

* June is overall warmer than December, with the mean temperature being three degrees higher
* June also has higher minimum and maximum temperatures compared to December
* There areclose to 200 more data points for June than for December, however this discrepancy 

## Summary

Based on the data we gathered on the temperatures on Oahu in June and December, the surf and icecream shop should be sustainable over the course of the entire year as the weather is consistently mild with a variation of just three degrees for the average temperature during both months.

If we wanted to continue to dive deeper into the data, we could begin to prepare for weather variation by finding out which months see the most precipitation. We could also look into the frequency of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall or very high temperatures.
